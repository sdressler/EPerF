Usage
-----

From the projects root directory, you can

	- build all (without documentation): make
	- build the documentation: make doc
	- build the library: make lib
	- build the examples: make examples

When building the library you'll get a shared object within the
"lib" folder. Link against the object and refer to the provided
headers within "include" (see examples) for using ePerF.

Note that before building the examples you should build the library.
