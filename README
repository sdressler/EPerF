This is part of the ENHANCE project.

Usage
-----

First, please execute ./configure and set the desired options. Actually
two options are available:

	- --disable-c-api (Disables the C API interface)
	- --disable-fortran-api (Disables the FORTRAN API interface)

Please note, that when you disable the C API you will also have to disable
the FORTRAN API.

After configure simply type:

	- make (build lib + examples)
	- make doc (build doxygen documentation)
	- make lib (build library only)
	- make examples (build examples only)

When building the library you'll get a shared object within the
"lib" folder. Link against the object and refer to the provided
headers within "include" (see examples) for using ePerF.

Note that before building the examples you should build the library.
