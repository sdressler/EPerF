BMBF grant no.: 01IH11004A-G

Disclaimer
---------

This software is currently in a very early stadium. There is no guarantee
that measurements are consistently correct and that the software is fully
bug-free. Bug reports, feature requests and general feedback are welcome.

Requirements
------------

* C++ compiler (C / FORTRAN compiler for API support)
* SQLite (>= 3.6)
* OpenMP

Usage
-----

First, have a look at Makefile.inc in order to change some configuration
parameters. Then, simply type

    make (build lib + examples)
	make doc (build doxygen documentation)
	make lib (build library only)
	make examples (build examples only)

When building the library you'll get a shared object within the
"lib" folder. Link against the object and refer to the provided
headers within "include" (see examples) for using ePerF.

Note that before building the examples you should build the library.
